# Three.JS - Shell Texture

### Description
This repository is my attempt to replicate the shell-texture effect using .glsl and Three.JS, following a tutorial by Acerola. 
I'm new to three.js and glsl so this serves as a practical learning.

Go check [Acerola channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t)
